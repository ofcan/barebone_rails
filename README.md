# Barebone typical Rails app

Every app I've done in Rails has exactly the same beginning. I've decided to
make it easy on myself and have made a repo containing the code.

You can see the whole guide on my blog in the post ['How I setup my Rails
apps'](http://svenduplic.com/2012/12/22/how-i-setup-my-rails-app.html)

### Workflow

Clone the repo and hack away!

# Barebone typical Rails app

Every app I've done in Rails has exactly the same beginning. I've decided to
make it easy on myself and have made a repo containing the code.

You can see the whole guide on my blog in the post ['How I setup my Rails
apps'](http://svenduplic.com/2012/12/22/how-i-setup-my-rails-app.html). This is
how the home page looks like.

### Workflow

Clone the repo and hack away! Remember to change the code in .ruby-version file
to correspond to you gemset and ruby version.
